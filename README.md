# Graphical_Arrow_Scoring
This is a python script using John Zelle's graphics.py library to score arrows graphically. 


To score a round, open run the Python script to open the GUI. Enter the number of arrows you plan to score per end and the number of ends you wish to score,
pressing the green button to proceed. Then use your mouse to select the position of each arrow on the target. The application will only let you proceed to the next end
if you have entered the correct number of arrows. Press any key to go to the next end, and continue until you have shot the number of ends entered on the second screen.
Upon finishing the round, all arrows will be displayed on the target with the final score underneath.
